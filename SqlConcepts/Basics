Today I have learnt how to retrieve only one column from the tables.
select coulumname from tablename.
CRUD Operations
SELECT first_name, last_name FROM employees WHERE department_id = 10;//here we are retrieving the first_name, last_name by using department_id
INSERT INTO employees (first_name, last_name, department_id) VALUES (‘John’, ‘Doe’, 10);
UPDATE employees SET department_id = 20 WHERE last_name = ‘Doe’; //here we are updating values into employees table
DELETE FROM employees WHERE last_name = ‘Doe’ AND first_name = ‘John’;// deleting the value from employees table.

Joins,Aggregrate,Group by, having , count
